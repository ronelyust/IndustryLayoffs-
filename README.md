# Industry Layoffs Data Cleaning & Analysis
SQL Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Features
* Cleaned and transformed a raw dataset on global tech layoffs using SQL, focusing on data integrity and consistency for accurate analysis.
* Created staging tables to preserve raw data and performed key data cleaning tasks:
  * Removed duplicate entries using window functions and row numbering techniques.
  * Standardized inconsistent data (e.g., industry names, country codes, and date formats).
  * Handled null and missing values by cross-referencing company data and removing unreliable records.
  * Optimized the dataset by removing unnecessary columns post-cleaning.
* Converted textual date formats into SQL date types to enable time-series analysis.
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in layoffs across industries, countries, and time periods:
  * Identified 2022 and early 2023 as peak periods for layoffs, correlating with economic downturns.
  * Revealed that startups and early-stage companies were disproportionately affected, with some billion-dollar companies like Quibi and BlockFi shutting down.
  * Found that tech giants (e.g., Amazon, Meta, Google) led layoffs from 2022 onwards, marking a shift from early-pandemic job losses concentrated in travel and hospitality industries.
  * Analyzed monthly rolling totals to pinpoint spikes in layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic economic adjustments.
